# Connect 4 Game Solver

This connect 4 solver is desgined by PascalPons, link to his solver: https://github.com/PascalPons/connect4

It illustrates how to write a strong Connect AI, following the [step by step tutorial to solve connect 4](http://blog.gamesolver.org)

### However, if you download his code from github and compile it, it does not work

Realted issues can be seen here https://github.com/PascalPons/connect4/issues/26 

He did not respond a long time, maybe he is too busy and have no time to maintain the repo.


### My work here to make things work again.
I followed his step by step tutorial to solve connect 4 and write everything again according to the instructions. After following the tutorial, the performance is still not as great as [his website](https://connect4.gamesolver.org/) .

So, I studied his repo carefully, reducing codes uncessary for a default 7x6 connect 4 board, adding 7x6 books to improve performance.

This repo works perfectly after compiling, solving connect 4 in 7x6 boards as fast as his online solver.
